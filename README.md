Repository for trying out GitHub

I am interested in leading artificial intelligence to bring business benefits, whether they are improvement in operational efficiency and new growth. I believe business leaders need to have a basic understanding of the technology to be able to recognise business problems and opportunities that machine learning and robotic process automation can solve. That is why I have set out to learn to code and train AI myself.
